      "My fellow citizens :\n",
      "I stand here today humbled by the task before us , grateful for the trust you have bestowed , mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors . I thank President Bush for his service to our nation , as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition .\n",
      "Forty - four Americans have now taken the presidential oath . The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace . Yet , every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms . At these moments , America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office , but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers , and true to our founding documents .\n",
      "So it has been . So it must be with this generation of Americans .\n",
      "That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood . Our nation is at war , against a far - reaching network of violence and hatred . Our economy is badly weakened , a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some , but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age . Homes have been lost ; jobs shed ; businesses shuttered . Our health care is too costly ; our schools fail too many ; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet .\n",
      "These are the indicators of crisis , subject to data and statistics . Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land -- a nagging fear that America ' s decline is inevitable , that the next generation must lower its sights .\n",
      "Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real . They are serious and they are many . They will not be met easily or in a short span of time . But know this , America -- they will be met .\n",
      "On this day , we gather because we have chosen hope over fear , unity of purpose over conflict and discord .\n",
      "On this day , we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises , the recriminations and worn - out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics .\n",
      "We remain a young nation , but in the words of Scripture , the time has come to set aside childish things . The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit ; to choose our better history ; to carry forward that precious gift , that noble idea , passed on from generation to generation : the God - given promise that all are equal , all are free , and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness .\n",
      "In reaffirming the greatness of our nation , we understand that greatness is never a given . It must be earned . Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less . It has not been the path for the faint - hearted -- for those who prefer leisure over work , or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame . Rather , it has been the risk - takers , the doers , the makers of things ' some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor , who have carried us up the long , rugged path towards prosperity and freedom .\n",
      "For us , they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life .\n",
      "For us , they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West ; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth .\n",
      "For us , they fought and died , in places like Concord and Gettysburg ; Normandy and Khe Sahn .\n",
      "Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life . They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions ; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction .\n",
      "This is the journey we continue today . We remain the most prosperous , powerful nation on Earth . Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began . Our minds are no less inventive , our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year . Our capacity remains undiminished . But our time of standing pat , of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions -- that time has surely passed . Starting today , we must pick ourselves up , dust ourselves off , and begin again the work of remaking America .\n",
      "For everywhere we look , there is work to be done . The state of our economy calls for action , bold and swift , and we will act -- not only to create new jobs , but to lay a new foundation for growth . We will build the roads and bridges , the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together . We will restore science to its rightful place , and wield technology ' s wonders to raise health care ' s quality and lower its cost . We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories . And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age . All this we can do . All this we will do .\n",
      "Now , there are some who question the scale of our ambitions -- who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans . Their memories are short . For they have forgotten what this country has already done ; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose , and necessity to courage .\n",
      "What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them -- that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply . The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small , but whether it works -- whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage , care they can afford , a retirement that is dignified . Where the answer is yes , we intend to move forward . Where the answer is no , programs will end . And those of us who manage the public ' s dollars will be held to account -- to spend wisely , reform bad habits , and do our business in the light of day -- because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government .\n",
      "Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill . Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched , but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye , the market can spin out of control -- the nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous . The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our Gross Domestic Product , but on the reach of our prosperity ; on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart -- not out of charity , but because it is the surest route to our common good .\n",

      "We have a place , all of us , in a long story -- a story we continue , but whose end we will not see . It is the story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old , a story of a slave - holding society that became a servant of freedom , the story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess , to defend but not to conquer .\n",
      "It is the American story -- a story of flawed and fallible people , united across the generations by grand and enduring ideals .\n",
      "The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American promise that everyone belongs , that everyone deserves a chance , that no insignificant person was ever born .\n",
      "Americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws . And though our nation has sometimes halted , and sometimes delayed , we must follow no other course .\n",
      "Through much of the last century , America ' s faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea . Now it is a seed upon the wind , taking root in many nations .\n",
      "Our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country , it is the inborn hope of our humanity , an ideal we carry but do not own , a trust we bear and pass along . And even after nearly 225 years , we have a long way yet to travel .\n",
      "While many of our citizens prosper , others doubt the promise , even the justice , of our own country . The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth . And sometimes our differences run so deep , it seems we share a continent , but not a country .\n",
      "We do not accept this , and we will not allow it . Our unity , our union , is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation . And this is my solemn pledge : I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity .\n",
      "I know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves who creates us equal in His image .\n",
      "And we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward .\n",
      "America has never been united by blood or birth or soil . We are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds , lift us above our interests and teach us what it means to be citizens . Every child must be taught these principles . Every citizen must uphold them . And every immigrant , by embracing these ideals , makes our country more , not less , American .\n",
      "Today , we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation ' s promise through civility , courage , compassion and character .\n",
      "America , at its best , matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility . A civil society demands from each of us good will and respect , fair dealing and forgiveness .\n",
      "Some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because , in a time of peace , the stakes of our debates appear small .\n",
      "But the stakes for America are never small . If our country does not lead the cause of freedom , it will not be led . If we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character , we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism . If we permit our economy to drift and decline , the vulnerable will suffer most .\n",
      "We must live up to the calling we share . Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment . It is the determined choice of trust over cynicism , of community over chaos . And this commitment , if we keep it , is a way to shared accomplishment .\n",
