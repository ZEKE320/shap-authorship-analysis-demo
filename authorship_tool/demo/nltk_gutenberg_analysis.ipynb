      "[ The Ball and The Cross by G . K . Chesterton 1909 ]\n",
      "I . A DISCUSSION SOMEWHAT IN THE AIR\n",
      "The flying ship of Professor Lucifer sang through the skies like a silver arrow ; the bleak white steel of it , gleaming in the bleak blue emptiness of the evening . That it was far above the earth was no expression for it ; to the two men in it , it seemed to be far above the stars . The professor had himself invented the flying machine , and had also invented nearly everything in it . Every sort of tool or apparatus had , in consequence , to the full , that fantastic and distorted look which belongs to the miracles of science . For the world of science and evolution is far more nameless and elusive and like a dream than the world of poetry and religion ; since in the latter images and ideas remain themselves eternally , while it is the whole idea of evolution that identities melt into each other as they do in a nightmare .\n",
      "All the tools of Professor Lucifer were the ancient human tools gone mad , grown into unrecognizable shapes , forgetful of their origin , forgetful of their names . That thing which looked like an enormous key with three wheels was really a patent and very deadly revolver . That object which seemed to be created by the entanglement of two corkscrews was really the key . The thing which might have been mistaken for a tricycle turned upside - down was the inexpressibly important instrument to which the corkscrew was the key . All these things , as I say , the professor had invented ; he had invented everything in the flying ship , with the exception , perhaps , of himself . This he had been born too late actually to inaugurate , but he believed at least , that he had considerably improved it .\n",
      "There was , however , another man on board , so to speak , at the time . Him , also , by a curious coincidence , the professor had not invented , and him he had not even very greatly improved , though he had fished him up with a lasso out of his own back garden , in Western Bulgaria , with the pure object of improving him . He was an exceedingly holy man , almost entirely covered with white hair . You could see nothing but his eyes , and he seemed to talk with them . A monk of immense learning and acute intellect he had made himself happy in a little stone hut and a little stony garden in the Balkans , chiefly by writing the most crushing refutations of exposures of certain heresies , the last professors of which had been burnt ( generally by each other ) precisely 1 , 119 years previously . They were really very plausible and thoughtful heresies , and it was really a creditable or even glorious circumstance , that the old monk had been intellectual enough to detect their fallacy ; the only misfortune was that nobody in the modern world was intellectual enough even to understand their argument . The old monk , one of whose names was Michael , and the other a name quite impossible to remember or repeat in our Western civilization , had , however , as I have said , made himself quite happy while he was in a mountain hermitage in the society of wild animals . And now that his luck had lifted him above all the mountains in the society of a wild physicist , he made himself happy still .\n",
      "\" I have no intention , my good Michael ,\" said Professor Lucifer , \" of endeavouring to convert you by argument . The imbecility of your traditions can be quite finally exhibited to anybody with mere ordinary knowledge of the world , the same kind of knowledge which teaches us not to sit in draughts or not to encourage friendliness in impecunious people . It is folly to talk of this or that demonstrating the rationalist philosophy . Everything demonstrates it . Rubbing shoulders with men of all kinds ----\"\n",
      "\" You will forgive me ,\" said the monk , meekly from under loads of white beard , \" but I fear I do not understand ; was it in order that I might rub my shoulder against men of all kinds that you put me inside this thing ?\"\n",
      "\" An entertaining retort , in the narrow and deductive manner of the Middle Ages ,\" replied the Professor , calmly , \" but even upon your own basis I will illustrate my point . We are up in the sky . In your religion and all the religions , as far as I know ( and I know everything ), the sky is made the symbol of everything that is sacred and merciful . Well , now you are in the sky , you know better . Phrase it how you like , twist it how you like , you know that you know better . You know what are a man ' s real feelings about the heavens , when he finds himself alone in the heavens , surrounded by the heavens . You know the truth , and the truth is this . The heavens are evil , the sky is evil , the stars are evil . This mere space , this mere quantity , terrifies a man more than tigers or the terrible plague . You know that since our science has spoken , the bottom has fallen out of the Universe . Now , heaven is the hopeless thing , more hopeless than any hell . Now , if there be any comfort for all your miserable progeny of morbid apes , it must be in the earth , underneath you , under the roots of the grass , in the place where hell was of old . The fiery crypts , the lurid cellars of the underworld , to which you once condemned the wicked , are hideous enough , but at least they are more homely than the heaven in which we ride . And the time will come when you will all hide in them , to escape the horror of the stars .\"\n",
      "\" I hope you will excuse my interrupting you ,\" said Michael , with a slight cough , \" but I have always noticed ----\"\n",
      "\" Go on , pray go on ,\" said Professor Lucifer , radiantly , \" I really like to draw out your simple ideas .\"\n",

      "[ Emma by Jane Austen 1816 ]\n",
      "VOLUME I\n",
      "CHAPTER I\n",
      "Emma Woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich , with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; and had lived nearly twenty - one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her .\n",
      "She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister ' s marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period . Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses ; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess , who had fallen little short of a mother in affection .\n",
      "Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr . Woodhouse ' s family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of Emma . Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters . Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess , the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint ; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away , they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached , and Emma doing just what she liked ; highly esteeming Miss Taylor ' s judgment , but directed chiefly by her own .\n",
      "The real evils , indeed , of Emma ' s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way , and a disposition to think a little too well of herself ; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments . The danger , however , was at present so unperceived , that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her .\n",
      "Sorrow came -- a gentle sorrow -- but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness .-- Miss Taylor married . It was Miss Taylor ' s loss which first brought grief . It was on the wedding - day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance . The wedding over , and the bride - people gone , her father and herself were left to dine together , with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening . Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner , as usual , and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost .\n",
      "The event had every promise of happiness for her friend . Mr . Weston was a man of unexceptionable character , easy fortune , suitable age , and pleasant manners ; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self - denying , generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match ; but it was a black morning ' s work for her . The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day . She recalled her past kindness -- the kindness , the affection of sixteen years -- how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old -- how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health -- and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood . A large debt of gratitude was owing here ; but the intercourse of the last seven years , the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella ' s marriage , on their being left to each other , was yet a dearer , tenderer recollection . She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed : intelligent , well - informed , useful , gentle , knowing all the ways of the family , interested in all its concerns , and peculiarly interested in herself , in every pleasure , every scheme of hers -- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose , and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault .\n",
      "How was she to bear the change ?-- It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs . Weston , only half a mile from them , and a Miss Taylor in the house ; and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude . She dearly loved her father , but he was no companion for her . He could not meet her in conversation , rational or playful .\n",

       "that you ought to hear. I could not give any connected detail yesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the\n",
       "unseasonableness with which the affair burst out, needs explanation; for though the event of the 26th ult ., as you\n",

       "she did not think sufficient .-- She was displeased; I thought unreasonably so: I thought her, on a thousand \n",
       "occasions, unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious: I thought her even cold. But she was always right. If I had \n",

       "useless ?-- Had we been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been suspected .-- I\n",
       "was mad enough, however, to resent .-- I doubted her affection. I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when, \n",
       "provoked by such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect of her, and such apparent devotion to Miss W \n",
       "., as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her resentment in a form of words \n",
       "perfectly intelligible to me .-- In short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side, abominable on \n",
       "mine; and I returned the same evening to Richmond, though I might have staid with you till the next morning, merely\n",
       "because I would be as angry with her as possible. Even then, I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled \n",
       "in time; but I was the injured person, injured by her coldness, and I went away determined that she should make the\n",
       "first advances .-- I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party. Had you witnessed my\n",
       "behaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again. Its effect upon her appears in \n",

       "offer of that officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her, by the bye, has ever filled me with\n",
       "indignation and hatred. I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards \n",
       "myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known .-- ` Jane ,' \n",
       "indeed !-- You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name, even to you. Think, \n",
       "then, what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless \n",
       "repetition, and all the insolence of imaginary superiority. Have patience with me, I shall soon have done .-- She \n",
       "closed with this offer, resolving to break with me entirely, and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were \n",

       "., as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her resentment in a form of words \n",
       "perfectly intelligible to me .-- In short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side, abominable on \n",
       "mine; and I returned the same evening to Richmond, though I might have staid with you till the next morning, merely\n",
       "because I would be as angry with her as possible. Even then, I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled \n",
       "in time; but I was the injured person, injured by her coldness, and I went away determined that she should make the\n",
       "first advances .-- I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party. Had you witnessed my\n",
       "behaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again. Its effect upon her appears in \n",

       "offer of that officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her, by the bye, has ever filled me with\n",
       "indignation and hatred. I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards \n",
       "myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known .-- ` Jane ,' \n",
       "indeed !-- You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name, even to you. Think, \n",
       "then, what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless \n",
       "repetition, and all the insolence of imaginary superiority. Have patience with me, I shall soon have done .-- She \n",
