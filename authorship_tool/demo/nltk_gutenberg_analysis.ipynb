      "[ The Ball and The Cross by G . K . Chesterton 1909 ]\n",
      "I . A DISCUSSION SOMEWHAT IN THE AIR\n",
      "The flying ship of Professor Lucifer sang through the skies like a silver arrow ; the bleak white steel of it , gleaming in the bleak blue emptiness of the evening . That it was far above the earth was no expression for it ; to the two men in it , it seemed to be far above the stars . The professor had himself invented the flying machine , and had also invented nearly everything in it . Every sort of tool or apparatus had , in consequence , to the full , that fantastic and distorted look which belongs to the miracles of science . For the world of science and evolution is far more nameless and elusive and like a dream than the world of poetry and religion ; since in the latter images and ideas remain themselves eternally , while it is the whole idea of evolution that identities melt into each other as they do in a nightmare .\n",
      "All the tools of Professor Lucifer were the ancient human tools gone mad , grown into unrecognizable shapes , forgetful of their origin , forgetful of their names . That thing which looked like an enormous key with three wheels was really a patent and very deadly revolver . That object which seemed to be created by the entanglement of two corkscrews was really the key . The thing which might have been mistaken for a tricycle turned upside - down was the inexpressibly important instrument to which the corkscrew was the key . All these things , as I say , the professor had invented ; he had invented everything in the flying ship , with the exception , perhaps , of himself . This he had been born too late actually to inaugurate , but he believed at least , that he had considerably improved it .\n",
      "There was , however , another man on board , so to speak , at the time . Him , also , by a curious coincidence , the professor had not invented , and him he had not even very greatly improved , though he had fished him up with a lasso out of his own back garden , in Western Bulgaria , with the pure object of improving him . He was an exceedingly holy man , almost entirely covered with white hair . You could see nothing but his eyes , and he seemed to talk with them . A monk of immense learning and acute intellect he had made himself happy in a little stone hut and a little stony garden in the Balkans , chiefly by writing the most crushing refutations of exposures of certain heresies , the last professors of which had been burnt ( generally by each other ) precisely 1 , 119 years previously . They were really very plausible and thoughtful heresies , and it was really a creditable or even glorious circumstance , that the old monk had been intellectual enough to detect their fallacy ; the only misfortune was that nobody in the modern world was intellectual enough even to understand their argument . The old monk , one of whose names was Michael , and the other a name quite impossible to remember or repeat in our Western civilization , had , however , as I have said , made himself quite happy while he was in a mountain hermitage in the society of wild animals . And now that his luck had lifted him above all the mountains in the society of a wild physicist , he made himself happy still .\n",
      "\" I have no intention , my good Michael ,\" said Professor Lucifer , \" of endeavouring to convert you by argument . The imbecility of your traditions can be quite finally exhibited to anybody with mere ordinary knowledge of the world , the same kind of knowledge which teaches us not to sit in draughts or not to encourage friendliness in impecunious people . It is folly to talk of this or that demonstrating the rationalist philosophy . Everything demonstrates it . Rubbing shoulders with men of all kinds ----\"\n",
      "\" You will forgive me ,\" said the monk , meekly from under loads of white beard , \" but I fear I do not understand ; was it in order that I might rub my shoulder against men of all kinds that you put me inside this thing ?\"\n",
      "\" An entertaining retort , in the narrow and deductive manner of the Middle Ages ,\" replied the Professor , calmly , \" but even upon your own basis I will illustrate my point . We are up in the sky . In your religion and all the religions , as far as I know ( and I know everything ), the sky is made the symbol of everything that is sacred and merciful . Well , now you are in the sky , you know better . Phrase it how you like , twist it how you like , you know that you know better . You know what are a man ' s real feelings about the heavens , when he finds himself alone in the heavens , surrounded by the heavens . You know the truth , and the truth is this . The heavens are evil , the sky is evil , the stars are evil . This mere space , this mere quantity , terrifies a man more than tigers or the terrible plague . You know that since our science has spoken , the bottom has fallen out of the Universe . Now , heaven is the hopeless thing , more hopeless than any hell . Now , if there be any comfort for all your miserable progeny of morbid apes , it must be in the earth , underneath you , under the roots of the grass , in the place where hell was of old . The fiery crypts , the lurid cellars of the underworld , to which you once condemned the wicked , are hideous enough , but at least they are more homely than the heaven in which we ride . And the time will come when you will all hide in them , to escape the horror of the stars .\"\n",
      "\" I hope you will excuse my interrupting you ,\" said Michael , with a slight cough , \" but I have always noticed ----\"\n",
      "\" Go on , pray go on ,\" said Professor Lucifer , radiantly , \" I really like to draw out your simple ideas .\"\n",

      "[ Emma by Jane Austen 1816 ]\n",
      "VOLUME I\n",
      "CHAPTER I\n",
      "Emma Woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich , with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; and had lived nearly twenty - one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her .\n",
      "She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister ' s marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period . Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses ; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess , who had fallen little short of a mother in affection .\n",
      "Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr . Woodhouse ' s family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of Emma . Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters . Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess , the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint ; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away , they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached , and Emma doing just what she liked ; highly esteeming Miss Taylor ' s judgment , but directed chiefly by her own .\n",
      "The real evils , indeed , of Emma ' s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way , and a disposition to think a little too well of herself ; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments . The danger , however , was at present so unperceived , that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her .\n",
      "Sorrow came -- a gentle sorrow -- but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness .-- Miss Taylor married . It was Miss Taylor ' s loss which first brought grief . It was on the wedding - day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance . The wedding over , and the bride - people gone , her father and herself were left to dine together , with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening . Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner , as usual , and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost .\n",
      "The event had every promise of happiness for her friend . Mr . Weston was a man of unexceptionable character , easy fortune , suitable age , and pleasant manners ; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self - denying , generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match ; but it was a black morning ' s work for her . The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day . She recalled her past kindness -- the kindness , the affection of sixteen years -- how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old -- how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health -- and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood . A large debt of gratitude was owing here ; but the intercourse of the last seven years , the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella ' s marriage , on their being left to each other , was yet a dearer , tenderer recollection . She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed : intelligent , well - informed , useful , gentle , knowing all the ways of the family , interested in all its concerns , and peculiarly interested in herself , in every pleasure , every scheme of hers -- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose , and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault .\n",
      "How was she to bear the change ?-- It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs . Weston , only half a mile from them , and a Miss Taylor in the house ; and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude . She dearly loved her father , but he was no companion for her . He could not meet her in conversation , rational or playful .\n",
