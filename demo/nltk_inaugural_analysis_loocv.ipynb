      "My fellow citizens :\n",
      "I stand here today humbled by the task before us , grateful for the trust you have bestowed , mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors . I thank President Bush for his service to our nation , as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition .\n",
      "Forty - four Americans have now taken the presidential oath . The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace . Yet , every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms . At these moments , America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office , but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers , and true to our founding documents .\n",
      "So it has been . So it must be with this generation of Americans .\n",
      "That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood . Our nation is at war , against a far - reaching network of violence and hatred . Our economy is badly weakened , a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some , but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age . Homes have been lost ; jobs shed ; businesses shuttered . Our health care is too costly ; our schools fail too many ; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet .\n",
      "These are the indicators of crisis , subject to data and statistics . Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land -- a nagging fear that America ' s decline is inevitable , that the next generation must lower its sights .\n",
      "Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real . They are serious and they are many . They will not be met easily or in a short span of time . But know this , America -- they will be met .\n",
      "On this day , we gather because we have chosen hope over fear , unity of purpose over conflict and discord .\n",
      "On this day , we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises , the recriminations and worn - out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics .\n",
      "We remain a young nation , but in the words of Scripture , the time has come to set aside childish things . The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit ; to choose our better history ; to carry forward that precious gift , that noble idea , passed on from generation to generation : the God - given promise that all are equal , all are free , and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness .\n",
      "In reaffirming the greatness of our nation , we understand that greatness is never a given . It must be earned . Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less . It has not been the path for the faint - hearted -- for those who prefer leisure over work , or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame . Rather , it has been the risk - takers , the doers , the makers of things ' some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor , who have carried us up the long , rugged path towards prosperity and freedom .\n",
      "For us , they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life .\n",
      "For us , they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West ; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth .\n",
      "For us , they fought and died , in places like Concord and Gettysburg ; Normandy and Khe Sahn .\n",
      "Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life . They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions ; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction .\n",
      "This is the journey we continue today . We remain the most prosperous , powerful nation on Earth . Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began . Our minds are no less inventive , our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year . Our capacity remains undiminished . But our time of standing pat , of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions -- that time has surely passed . Starting today , we must pick ourselves up , dust ourselves off , and begin again the work of remaking America .\n",
      "For everywhere we look , there is work to be done . The state of our economy calls for action , bold and swift , and we will act -- not only to create new jobs , but to lay a new foundation for growth . We will build the roads and bridges , the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together . We will restore science to its rightful place , and wield technology ' s wonders to raise health care ' s quality and lower its cost . We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories . And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age . All this we can do . All this we will do .\n",
      "Now , there are some who question the scale of our ambitions -- who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans . Their memories are short . For they have forgotten what this country has already done ; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose , and necessity to courage .\n",
      "What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them -- that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply . The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small , but whether it works -- whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage , care they can afford , a retirement that is dignified . Where the answer is yes , we intend to move forward . Where the answer is no , programs will end . And those of us who manage the public ' s dollars will be held to account -- to spend wisely , reform bad habits , and do our business in the light of day -- because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government .\n",
      "Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill . Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched , but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye , the market can spin out of control -- the nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous . The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our Gross Domestic Product , but on the reach of our prosperity ; on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart -- not out of charity , but because it is the surest route to our common good .\n",

      "There is a man here who has earned a lasting place in our hearts and in our history . President Reagan , on behalf of our Nation , I thank you for the wonderful things that you have done for America .\n",
      "I have just repeated word for word the oath taken by George Washington 200 years ago , and the Bible on which I placed my hand is the Bible on which he placed his . It is right that the memory of Washington be with us today , not only because this is our Bicentennial Inauguration , but because Washington remains the Father of our Country . And he would , I think , be gladdened by this day ; for today is the concrete expression of a stunning fact : our continuity these 200 years since our government began .\n",
      "We meet on democracy ' s front porch , a good place to talk as neighbors and as friends . For this is a day when our nation is made whole , when our differences , for a moment , are suspended .\n",
      "And my first act as President is a prayer . I ask you to bow your heads :\n",
      "Heavenly Father , we bow our heads and thank You for Your love . Accept our thanks for the peace that yields this day and the shared faith that makes its continuance likely . Make us strong to do Your work , willing to heed and hear Your will , and write on our hearts these words : \" Use power to help people .\" For we are given power not to advance our own purposes , nor to make a great show in the world , nor a name . There is but one just use of power , and it is to serve people . Help us to remember it , Lord . Amen .\n",
      "I come before you and assume the Presidency at a moment rich with promise . We live in a peaceful , prosperous time , but we can make it better . For a new breeze is blowing , and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn ; for in man ' s heart , if not in fact , the day of the dictator is over . The totalitarian era is passing , its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient , lifeless tree . A new breeze is blowing , and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push on . There is new ground to be broken , and new action to be taken . There are times when the future seems thick as a fog ; you sit and wait , hoping the mists will lift and reveal the right path . But this is a time when the future seems a door you can walk right through into a room called tomorrow .\n",
      "Great nations of the world are moving toward democracy through the door to freedom . Men and women of the world move toward free markets through the door to prosperity . The people of the world agitate for free expression and free thought through the door to the moral and intellectual satisfactions that only liberty allows .\n",
      "We know what works : Freedom works . We know what ' s right : Freedom is right . We know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for man on Earth : through free markets , free speech , free elections , and the exercise of free will unhampered by the state .\n",
      "For the first time in this century , for the first time in perhaps all history , man does not have to invent a system by which to live . We don ' t have to talk late into the night about which form of government is better . We don ' t have to wrest justice from the kings . We only have to summon it from within ourselves . We must act on what we know . I take as my guide the hope of a saint : In crucial things , unity ; in important things , diversity ; in all things , generosity .\n",
      "America today is a proud , free nation , decent and civil , a place we cannot help but love . We know in our hearts , not loudly and proudly , but as a simple fact , that this country has meaning beyond what we see , and that our strength is a force for good . But have we changed as a nation even in our time ? Are we enthralled with material things , less appreciative of the nobility of work and sacrifice ?\n",
      "My friends , we are not the sum of our possessions . They are not the measure of our lives . In our hearts we know what matters . We cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car , a bigger bank account . We must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend , a loving parent , a citizen who leaves his home , his neighborhood and town better than he found it . What do we want the men and women who work with us to say when we are no longer there ? That we were more driven to succeed than anyone around us ? Or that we stopped to ask if a sick child had gotten better , and stayed a moment there to trade a word of friendship ?\n",
      "No President , no government , can teach us to remember what is best in what we are . But if the man you have chosen to lead this government can help make a difference ; if he can celebrate the quieter , deeper successes that are made not of gold and silk , but of better hearts and finer souls ; if he can do these things , then he must .\n",
      "America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral principle . We as a people have such a purpose today . It is to make kinder the face of the Nation and gentler the face of the world . My friends , we have work to do . There are the homeless , lost and roaming . There are the children who have nothing , no love , no normalcy . There are those who cannot free themselves of enslavement to whatever addiction -- drugs , welfare , the demoralization that rules the slums . There is crime to be conquered , the rough crime of the streets . There are young women to be helped who are about to become mothers of children they can ' t care for and might not love . They need our care , our guidance , and our education , though we bless them for choosing life .\n",
      "The old solution , the old way , was to think that public money alone could end these problems . But we have learned that is not so . And in any case , our funds are low . We have a deficit to bring down . We have more will than wallet ; but will is what we need . We will make the hard choices , looking at what we have and perhaps allocating it differently , making our decisions based on honest need and prudent safety . And then we will do the wisest thing of all : We will turn to the only resource we have that in times of need always grows -- the goodness and the courage of the American people .\n",
      "I am speaking of a new engagement in the lives of others , a new activism , hands - on and involved , that gets the job done . We must bring in the generations , harnessing the unused talent of the elderly and the unfocused energy of the young . For not only leadership is passed from generation to generation , but so is stewardship . And the generation born after the Second World War has come of age .\n",
      "I have spoken of a thousand points of light , of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation , doing good . We will work hand in hand , encouraging , sometimes leading , sometimes being led , rewarding . We will work on this in the White House , in the Cabinet agencies . I will go to the people and the programs that are the brighter points of light , and I will ask every member of my government to become involved . The old ideas are new again because they are not old , they are timeless : duty , sacrifice , commitment , and a patriotism that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in .\n",
      "We need a new engagement , too , between the Executive and the Congress . The challenges before us will be thrashed out with the House and the Senate . We must bring the Federal budget into balance . And we must ensure that America stands before the world united , strong , at peace , and fiscally sound . But , of course , things may be difficult . We need compromise ; we have had dissension . We need harmony ; we have had a chorus of discordant voices .\n",
      "For Congress , too , has changed in our time . There has grown a certain divisiveness . We have seen the hard looks and heard the statements in which not each other ' s ideas are challenged , but each other ' s motives . And our great parties have too often been far apart and untrusting of each other . It has been this way since Vietnam . That war cleaves us still . But , friends , that war began in earnest a quarter of a century ago ; and surely the statute of limitations has been reached . This is a fact : The final lesson of Vietnam is that no great nation can long afford to be sundered by a memory . A new breeze is blowing , and the old bipartisanship must be made new again .\n",
      "To my friends -- and yes , I do mean friends -- in the loyal opposition -- and yes , I mean loyal : I put out my hand . I am putting out my hand to you , Mr . Speaker . I am putting out my hand to you Mr . Majority Leader . For this is the thing : This is the age of the offered hand . We can ' t turn back clocks , and I don ' t want to . But when our fathers were young , Mr . Speaker , our differences ended at the water ' s edge . And we don ' t wish to turn back time , but when our mothers were young , Mr . Majority Leader , the Congress and the Executive were capable of working together to produce a budget on which this nation could live . Let us negotiate soon and hard . But in the end , let us produce . The American people await action . They didn ' t send us here to bicker . They ask us to rise above the merely partisan . \" In crucial things , unity \" -- and this , my friends , is crucial .\n",
