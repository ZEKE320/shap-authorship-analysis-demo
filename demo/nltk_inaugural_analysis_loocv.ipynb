      "My fellow citizens :\n",
      "I stand here today humbled by the task before us , grateful for the trust you have bestowed , mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors . I thank President Bush for his service to our nation , as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition .\n",
      "Forty - four Americans have now taken the presidential oath . The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace . Yet , every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms . At these moments , America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office , but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers , and true to our founding documents .\n",
      "So it has been . So it must be with this generation of Americans .\n",
      "That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood . Our nation is at war , against a far - reaching network of violence and hatred . Our economy is badly weakened , a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some , but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age . Homes have been lost ; jobs shed ; businesses shuttered . Our health care is too costly ; our schools fail too many ; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet .\n",
      "These are the indicators of crisis , subject to data and statistics . Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land -- a nagging fear that America ' s decline is inevitable , that the next generation must lower its sights .\n",
      "Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real . They are serious and they are many . They will not be met easily or in a short span of time . But know this , America -- they will be met .\n",
      "On this day , we gather because we have chosen hope over fear , unity of purpose over conflict and discord .\n",
      "On this day , we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises , the recriminations and worn - out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics .\n",
      "We remain a young nation , but in the words of Scripture , the time has come to set aside childish things . The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit ; to choose our better history ; to carry forward that precious gift , that noble idea , passed on from generation to generation : the God - given promise that all are equal , all are free , and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness .\n",
      "In reaffirming the greatness of our nation , we understand that greatness is never a given . It must be earned . Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less . It has not been the path for the faint - hearted -- for those who prefer leisure over work , or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame . Rather , it has been the risk - takers , the doers , the makers of things ' some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor , who have carried us up the long , rugged path towards prosperity and freedom .\n",
      "For us , they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life .\n",
      "For us , they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West ; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth .\n",
      "For us , they fought and died , in places like Concord and Gettysburg ; Normandy and Khe Sahn .\n",
      "Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life . They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions ; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction .\n",
      "This is the journey we continue today . We remain the most prosperous , powerful nation on Earth . Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began . Our minds are no less inventive , our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year . Our capacity remains undiminished . But our time of standing pat , of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions -- that time has surely passed . Starting today , we must pick ourselves up , dust ourselves off , and begin again the work of remaking America .\n",
      "For everywhere we look , there is work to be done . The state of our economy calls for action , bold and swift , and we will act -- not only to create new jobs , but to lay a new foundation for growth . We will build the roads and bridges , the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together . We will restore science to its rightful place , and wield technology ' s wonders to raise health care ' s quality and lower its cost . We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories . And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age . All this we can do . All this we will do .\n",
      "Now , there are some who question the scale of our ambitions -- who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans . Their memories are short . For they have forgotten what this country has already done ; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose , and necessity to courage .\n",
      "What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them -- that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply . The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small , but whether it works -- whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage , care they can afford , a retirement that is dignified . Where the answer is yes , we intend to move forward . Where the answer is no , programs will end . And those of us who manage the public ' s dollars will be held to account -- to spend wisely , reform bad habits , and do our business in the light of day -- because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government .\n",
      "Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill . Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched , but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye , the market can spin out of control -- the nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous . The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our Gross Domestic Product , but on the reach of our prosperity ; on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart -- not out of charity , but because it is the surest route to our common good .\n",

It is right that the memory of Washington be with us today , not only because this is our Bicentennial Inauguration , but because Washington remains the Father of our Country . And he would , I think , be gladdened by this day ; for today is the concrete expression of a stunning fact : our continuity these 200 years since our government began .\n",

Make us strong to do Your work , willing to heed and hear Your will , and write on our hearts these words : \" Use power to help people .\" For we are given power not to advance our own purposes , nor to make a great show in the world , nor a name . There is but one just use of power , and it is to serve people . Help us to remember it , Lord . Amen .\n",
      "I come before you and assume the Presidency at a moment rich with promise . We live in a peaceful , prosperous time , but we can make it better . For a new breeze is blowing , and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn ; for in man ' s heart , if not in fact , the day of the dictator is over . The totalitarian era is passing , its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient , lifeless tree . A new breeze is blowing , and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push on . There is new ground to be broken , and new action to be taken . There are times when the future seems thick as a fog ; you sit and wait , hoping the mists will lift and reveal the right path . But this is a time when the future seems a door you can walk right through into a room called tomorrow .\n",

The people of the world agitate for free expression and free thought through the door to the moral and intellectual satisfactions that only liberty allows .\n",
      "We know what works : Freedom works . We know what ' s right : Freedom is right . We know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for man on Earth : through free markets , free speech , free elections , and the exercise of free will unhampered by the state .\n",
      "For the first time in this century , for the first time in perhaps all history , man does not have to invent a system by which to live . We don ' t have to talk late into the night about which form of government is better . We don ' t have to wrest justice from the kings . We only have to summon it from within ourselves . We must act on what we know . I take as my guide the hope of a saint : In crucial things , unity ; in important things , diversity ; in all things , generosity .\n",
      "America today is a proud , free nation , decent and civil , a place we cannot help but love . We know in our hearts , not loudly and proudly , but as a simple fact , that this country has meaning beyond what we see , and that our strength is a force for good . But have we changed as a nation even in our time ? Are we enthralled with material things , less appreciative of the nobility of work and sacrifice ?\n",
      "My friends , we are not the sum of our possessions . They are not the measure of our lives . In our hearts we know what matters . We cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car , a bigger bank account . We must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend , a loving parent , a citizen who leaves his home , his neighborhood and town better than he found it . What do we want the men and women who work with us to say when we are no longer there ? That we were more driven to succeed than anyone around us ? Or that we stopped to ask if a sick child had gotten better , and stayed a moment there to trade a word of friendship ?\n",
      "No President , no government , can teach us to remember what is best in what we are . But if the man you have chosen to lead this government can help make a difference ; if he can celebrate the quieter , deeper successes that are made not of gold and silk , but of better hearts and finer souls ; if he can do these things , then he must .\n",
      "America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral principle . We as a people have such a purpose today . It is to make kinder the face of the Nation and gentler the face of the world . My friends , we have work to do . There are the homeless , lost and roaming . There are the children who have nothing , no love , no normalcy . There are those who cannot free themselves of enslavement to whatever addiction -- drugs , welfare , the demoralization that rules the slums . There is crime to be conquered , the rough crime of the streets . There are young women to be helped who are about to become mothers of children they can ' t care for and might not love . They need our care , our guidance , and our education , though we bless them for choosing life .\n",
      "The old solution , the old way , was to think that public money alone could end these problems . But we have learned that is not so . And in any case , our funds are low . We have a deficit to bring down . We have more will than wallet ; but will is what we need . We will make the hard choices , looking at what we have and perhaps allocating it differently , making our decisions based on honest need and prudent safety . And then we will do the wisest thing of all : We will turn to the only resource we have that in times of need always grows -- the goodness and the courage of the American people .\n",
      "I am speaking of a new engagement in the lives of others , a new activism , hands - on and involved , that gets the job done . We must bring in the generations , harnessing the unused talent of the elderly and the unfocused energy of the young . For not only leadership is passed from generation to generation , but so is stewardship . And the generation born after the Second World War has come of age .\n",
      "I have spoken of a thousand points of light , of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation , doing good . We will work hand in hand , encouraging , sometimes leading , sometimes being led , rewarding . We will work on this in the White House , in the Cabinet agencies . I will go to the people and the programs that are the brighter points of light , and I will ask every member of my government to become involved . The old ideas are new again because they are not old , they are timeless : duty , sacrifice , commitment , and a patriotism that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in .\n",
      "We need a new engagement , too , between the Executive and the Congress . The challenges before us will be thrashed out with the House and the Senate . We must bring the Federal budget into balance . And we must ensure that America stands before the world united , strong , at peace , and fiscally sound . But , of course , things may be difficult . We need compromise ; we have had dissension . We need harmony ; we have had a chorus of discordant voices .\n",
      "For Congress , too , has changed in our time . There has grown a certain divisiveness . We have seen the hard looks and heard the statements in which not each other ' s ideas are challenged , but each other ' s motives . And our great parties have too often been far apart and untrusting of each other . It has been this way since Vietnam . That war cleaves us still . But , friends , that war began in earnest a quarter of a century ago ; and surely the statute of limitations has been reached . This is a fact : The final lesson of Vietnam is that no great nation can long afford to be sundered by a memory . A new breeze is blowing , and the old bipartisanship must be made new again .\n",
      "To my friends -- and yes , I do mean friends -- in the loyal opposition -- and yes , I mean loyal : I put out my hand . I am putting out my hand to you , Mr . Speaker . I am putting out my hand to you Mr . Majority Leader . For this is the thing : This is the age of the offered hand . We can ' t turn back clocks , and I don ' t want to . But when our fathers were young , Mr . Speaker , our differences ended at the water ' s edge . And we don ' t wish to turn back time , but when our mothers were young , Mr . Majority Leader , the Congress and the Executive were capable of working together to produce a budget on which this nation could live . Let us negotiate soon and hard . But in the end , let us produce . The American people await action . They didn ' t send us here to bicker . They ask us to rise above the merely partisan . \" In crucial things , unity \" -- and this , my friends , is crucial .\n",
