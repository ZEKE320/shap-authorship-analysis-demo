      "[ The Ball and The Cross by G . K . Chesterton 1909 ]\n",
      "I . A DISCUSSION SOMEWHAT IN THE AIR\n",
      "The flying ship of Professor Lucifer sang through the skies like a silver arrow ; the bleak white steel of it , gleaming in the bleak blue emptiness of the evening . That it was far above the earth was no expression for it ; to the two men in it , it seemed to be far above the stars . The professor had himself invented the flying machine , and had also invented nearly everything in it . Every sort of tool or apparatus had , in consequence , to the full , that fantastic and distorted look which belongs to the miracles of science . For the world of science and evolution is far more nameless and elusive and like a dream than the world of poetry and religion ; since in the latter images and ideas remain themselves eternally , while it is the whole idea of evolution that identities melt into each other as they do in a nightmare .\n",
      "All the tools of Professor Lucifer were the ancient human tools gone mad , grown into unrecognizable shapes , forgetful of their origin , forgetful of their names . That thing which looked like an enormous key with three wheels was really a patent and very deadly revolver . That object which seemed to be created by the entanglement of two corkscrews was really the key . The thing which might have been mistaken for a tricycle turned upside - down was the inexpressibly important instrument to which the corkscrew was the key . All these things , as I say , the professor had invented ; he had invented everything in the flying ship , with the exception , perhaps , of himself . This he had been born too late actually to inaugurate , but he believed at least , that he had considerably improved it .\n",
      "There was , however , another man on board , so to speak , at the time . Him , also , by a curious coincidence , the professor had not invented , and him he had not even very greatly improved , though he had fished him up with a lasso out of his own back garden , in Western Bulgaria , with the pure object of improving him . He was an exceedingly holy man , almost entirely covered with white hair . You could see nothing but his eyes , and he seemed to talk with them . A monk of immense learning and acute intellect he had made himself happy in a little stone hut and a little stony garden in the Balkans , chiefly by writing the most crushing refutations of exposures of certain heresies , the last professors of which had been burnt ( generally by each other ) precisely 1 , 119 years previously . They were really very plausible and thoughtful heresies , and it was really a creditable or even glorious circumstance , that the old monk had been intellectual enough to detect their fallacy ; the only misfortune was that nobody in the modern world was intellectual enough even to understand their argument . The old monk , one of whose names was Michael , and the other a name quite impossible to remember or repeat in our Western civilization , had , however , as I have said , made himself quite happy while he was in a mountain hermitage in the society of wild animals . And now that his luck had lifted him above all the mountains in the society of a wild physicist , he made himself happy still .\n",
      "\" I have no intention , my good Michael ,\" said Professor Lucifer , \" of endeavouring to convert you by argument . The imbecility of your traditions can be quite finally exhibited to anybody with mere ordinary knowledge of the world , the same kind of knowledge which teaches us not to sit in draughts or not to encourage friendliness in impecunious people . It is folly to talk of this or that demonstrating the rationalist philosophy . Everything demonstrates it . Rubbing shoulders with men of all kinds ----\"\n",
      "\" You will forgive me ,\" said the monk , meekly from under loads of white beard , \" but I fear I do not understand ; was it in order that I might rub my shoulder against men of all kinds that you put me inside this thing ?\"\n",
      "\" An entertaining retort , in the narrow and deductive manner of the Middle Ages ,\" replied the Professor , calmly , \" but even upon your own basis I will illustrate my point . We are up in the sky . In your religion and all the religions , as far as I know ( and I know everything ), the sky is made the symbol of everything that is sacred and merciful . Well , now you are in the sky , you know better . Phrase it how you like , twist it how you like , you know that you know better . You know what are a man ' s real feelings about the heavens , when he finds himself alone in the heavens , surrounded by the heavens . You know the truth , and the truth is this . The heavens are evil , the sky is evil , the stars are evil . This mere space , this mere quantity , terrifies a man more than tigers or the terrible plague . You know that since our science has spoken , the bottom has fallen out of the Universe . Now , heaven is the hopeless thing , more hopeless than any hell . Now , if there be any comfort for all your miserable progeny of morbid apes , it must be in the earth , underneath you , under the roots of the grass , in the place where hell was of old . The fiery crypts , the lurid cellars of the underworld , to which you once condemned the wicked , are hideous enough , but at least they are more homely than the heaven in which we ride . And the time will come when you will all hide in them , to escape the horror of the stars .\"\n",
      "\" I hope you will excuse my interrupting you ,\" said Michael , with a slight cough , \" but I have always noticed ----\"\n",
      "\" Go on , pray go on ,\" said Professor Lucifer , radiantly , \" I really like to draw out your simple ideas .\"\n",

      "[ Emma by Jane Austen 1816 ]\n",
      "VOLUME I\n",
      "CHAPTER I\n",
      "Emma Woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich , with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; and had lived nearly twenty - one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her .\n",
      "She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister ' s marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period . Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses ; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess , who had fallen little short of a mother in affection .\n",
      "Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr . Woodhouse ' s family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of Emma . Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters . Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess , the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint ; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away , they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached , and Emma doing just what she liked ; highly esteeming Miss Taylor ' s judgment , but directed chiefly by her own .\n",
      "The real evils , indeed , of Emma ' s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way , and a disposition to think a little too well of herself ; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments . The danger , however , was at present so unperceived , that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her .\n",
      "Sorrow came -- a gentle sorrow -- but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness .-- Miss Taylor married . It was Miss Taylor ' s loss which first brought grief . It was on the wedding - day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance . The wedding over , and the bride - people gone , her father and herself were left to dine together , with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening . Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner , as usual , and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost .\n",
      "The event had every promise of happiness for her friend . Mr . Weston was a man of unexceptionable character , easy fortune , suitable age , and pleasant manners ; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self - denying , generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match ; but it was a black morning ' s work for her . The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day . She recalled her past kindness -- the kindness , the affection of sixteen years -- how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old -- how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health -- and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood . A large debt of gratitude was owing here ; but the intercourse of the last seven years , the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella ' s marriage , on their being left to each other , was yet a dearer , tenderer recollection . She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed : intelligent , well - informed , useful , gentle , knowing all the ways of the family , interested in all its concerns , and peculiarly interested in herself , in every pleasure , every scheme of hers -- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose , and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault .\n",
      "How was she to bear the change ?-- It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs . Weston , only half a mile from them , and a Miss Taylor in the house ; and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude . She dearly loved her father , but he was no companion for her . He could not meet her in conversation , rational or playful .\n",

       "., as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her resentment in a form of words \n",
       "perfectly intelligible to me .-- In short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side, abominable on \n",
       "mine; and I returned the same evening to Richmond, though I might have staid with you till the next morning, merely\n",
       "because I would be as angry with her as possible. Even then, I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled \n",

       "first advances .-- I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party. Had you witnessed my\n",

       "indignation and hatred. I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards \n",
       "myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known .-- ` Jane ,' \n",
       "indeed !-- You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name, even to you. Think, \n",

       "me, was as much my conviction as my wish .-- She received my attentions with an easy, friendly, goodhumoured \n",
       "playfulness, which exactly suited me. We seemed to understand each other. From our relative situation, those \n",
       "attentions were her due, and were felt to be so .-- Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand me before the\n",

       "moment of confessing the truth, and I then fancied she was not without suspicion; but I have no doubt of her having\n",
       "since detected me, at least in some degree .-- She may not have surmised the whole, but her quickness must have \n",
       "penetrated a part. I cannot doubt it. You will find, whenever the subject becomes freed from its present \n",

       "so much brotherly affection, as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself .-- Whatever strange\n",
       "things I said or did during that fortnight, you have now a key to. My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to\n",
       "get my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion. If you remember any queernesses, set them \n",

       "her .-- The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam, is much beyond my power of doing \n",
       "justice to. You will soon, I earnestly hope, know her thoroughly yourself .-- No description can describe her. She \n",
       "must tell you herself what she is-- yet not by word, for never was there a human creature who would so designedly \n",
       "suppress her own merit .-- Since I began this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard from her \n",

       "opinion of her looks. I know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread of the visit. Perhaps it is paid \n",
       "already. Let me hear from you without delay; I am impatient for a thousand particulars. Remember how few minutes I \n",
       "was at Randalls, and in how \u001b[1;38;5;177mbewildered\u001b[0m, how mad a state: and I am not much better yet; still insane either from \n",
       "happiness or misery. When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with, of her excellence and patience, and \n",
       "my uncle ' s generosity, I am mad with joy: but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her, and how \n",
       "little I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger. If I could but see her again !-- But I must not propose it \n",
       "yet. My uncle has been too good for me to encroach .-- I must still add to this long letter. You have not heard all\n",
       "that you ought to hear. I could not give any connected detail yesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the\n",
       "unseasonableness with which the affair burst out, needs explanation; for though the event of the 26th ult ., as you\n",
       "will conclude, immediately opened to me the happiest prospects, I should not have presumed on such early measures, \n",
       "but from the very particular circumstances, which left me not an hour to lose. I should myself have shrunk from any\n",
       "thing so hasty, and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement .-- But I had\n",
       "no choice. The hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman-- Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to leave \n",
       "off abruptly, to recollect and compose myself .-- I have been walking over the country, and am now, I hope, \n",
       "rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be .-- It is, in fact, a most mortifying retrospect \n",
       "for me. I behaved shamefully. And here I can admit, that my manners to Miss W ., in being unpleasant to Miss F ., \n",
       "were highly blameable. _She_ disapproved them, which ought to have been enough .-- My plea of concealing the truth \n",
       "she did not think sufficient .-- She was displeased; I thought unreasonably so: I thought her, on a thousand \n",
       "occasions, unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious: I thought her even cold. But she was always right. If I had \n",
       "followed her judgment, and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should have escaped the \n",
       "greatest unhappiness I have ever known .-- We quarrelled .-- Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell ?-- \n",
       "_There_ every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis. I was late; I met her walking home \n",
       "by herself, and wanted to walk with her, but she would not suffer it. She absolutely refused to allow me, which I \n",
       "then thought most unreasonable. Now, however, I see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of \n",
       "discretion. While I, to blind the world to our engagement, was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity \n",
       "to another woman, was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution \n",
       "useless ?-- Had we been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been suspected .-- I\n",
       "was mad enough, however, to resent .-- I doubted her affection. I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when, \n",
       "provoked by such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect of her, and such apparent devotion to Miss W \n",
       "., as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her resentment in a form of words \n",
       "perfectly intelligible to me .-- In short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side, abominable on \n",
       "mine; and I returned the same evening to Richmond, though I might have staid with you till the next morning, merely\n",
       "because I would be as angry with her as possible. Even then, I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled \n",
       "in time; but I was the injured person, injured by her coldness, and I went away determined that she should make the\n",
       "first advances .-- I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party. Had you witnessed my\n",
       "behaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again. Its effect upon her appears in \n",
       "the immediate resolution it produced: as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls, she closed with the \n",
       "offer of that officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her, by the bye, has ever filled me with\n",
       "indignation and hatred. I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards \n",
       "myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known .-- ` Jane ,' \n",
       "indeed !-- You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name, even to you. Think, \n",
       "then, what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless \n",
       "repetition, and all the insolence of imaginary superiority. Have patience with me, I shall soon have done .-- She \n",
       "closed with this offer, resolving to break with me entirely, and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were \n",
       "to meet again .-- _She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ \n",
       "_each_: _she_ _dissolved_ _it_ .-- This letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt ' s death. I answered\n",
       "it within an hour; but from the confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once, my \n",
       "answer, instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day, was locked up in my writing- desk; and \n",
       "I, trusting that I had written enough, though but a few lines, to satisfy her, remained without any uneasiness .-- \n",
       "I was rather \u001b[1;38;5;177mdisappointed\u001b[0m that I did not hear from her again speedily; but I made excuses for her, and was too \n",
       "busy, and-- may I add ?-- too cheerful in my views to be captious .-- We removed to Windsor; and two days \n",
       "afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters all returned !-- and a few lines at the same time by the \n",
       "post, stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last; and adding, that as silence on\n",
       "such a point could not be misconstrued, and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate \n",
       "arrangement concluded as soon as possible, she now sent me, by a safe conveyance, all my letters, and requested, \n",

       "I knew the name, the place, I knew all about it, and instantly saw what she had been doing. It was perfectly \n",
       "accordant with that resolution of character which I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she had maintained, as to \n",
       "any such design in her former letter, was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy. For the world would not she \n",
       "have seemed to threaten me .-- Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I had actually detected my own blunder, I raved\n",

       "the time of day when, from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour, I was certain of a good chance of finding her\n",
